## 🤝 How to Contribute  
  
### For sending a PR: 
- Please use any ReadMe editor, I used [Stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/app#).  
- Follow the pattern of this doc to add new events in the list.  
- Before adding events or hackathons make sure it's not a duplicate or already added.
- You may find some same events in different months it's because we kept it as an example. You may update it with correct one by raising a PR.
- Before raising a `Pull Request` make sure to create an issue for the same.
- Don't forget to add the link to the event. **(IMPORTANT)**  
-   Pick an open issue from the  [issue list](https://github.com/imanishbarnwal/Online-Events-And-Hackathons/issues) and claim it in the comments. After approval fix the issue and send us a pull request (PR).  
-   All the PR’s need to be sent to the `master branch`.  
  
### To Open an issue:  
-   You can create a new issue and send the fix through a pull request.  
-   Please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure the issue you are reporting does not replicate an issue already reported.
